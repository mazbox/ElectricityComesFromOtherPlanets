Electricity Comes From Other Planets

This was part of an exhibition at Gaite Lyrique

Description

It consists of 3 programs. 

1. SphereMapper 
The projection mapping software that has a custom obj editing facility built into it.
Each one drives a projector, that points at 2 of the shapes.

2. SensorMidi
Listens to midi from Ableton Live and pipes it to the 4 instances of SphereMapper.
It listens to the CamStrip instances, which amongst other things, govern the volume levels
of individual tracks in Ableton Live

3. CamStrip
A program that lets you plug in 2 kinects pointing down from the ceiling, then draw boxes 
onto the image to create regions to trigger things.


I don't think anyone will be able to get it to run as is, also the Ableton Live set isn't
in here, but there might be useful code in here to help with other projects. 
May be worth a nosey.
